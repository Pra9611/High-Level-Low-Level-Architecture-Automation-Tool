# High-Level-Low-Level-Architecture-Automation-Tool

1. Project Title

AI-Based High-Level to Low-Level Architecture Conversion Tool

This is self-explanatory: it defines what the project is.

The tool converts business requirements (high-level) into technical specifications (low-level).

2. Objective

Automate the conversion of business requirements into:

Functional modules

Database schemas

API endpoints

Pseudocode

Purpose: Reduce manual work, minimize errors, and improve clarity between business analysts and developers.

3. Problem Statement

Currently, translating business requirements into technical designs is time-consuming and prone to mistakes.

The PDF clearly states the problem and why the project is needed.

Example:
High-level: “Users can register, browse products, and place orders.”
Low-level: You need database tables, APIs, and logic for each module.
